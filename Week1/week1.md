# Week 1

### Lab

#### Arduino Exercise 1

[Series Circuit](https://youtu.be/o7IhD0Vq9Ew)  
[Parallel Circuit](https://youtu.be/nQeZqB6rXlY)  
  
Through these three exercises, I was able to slowly recall the content on electricity and magnetism I learned during high school physics. Revisiting my old textbook and restudying some of the topics, also helped me to further understand the basics of how circuits work.

#### Arduino Exercise 2
  
[This video](https://youtu.be/KsxgXhPr5Qw) shows the work in progress for the Spaceship Interface exercise, as I forgot to take a video of the final result. An obstacle I came across was the red LED lights not blinking in alternation (as seen in the video), however, this was because I had forgotten to include the second `delay(250);` line.

### Homework Game

#### Prototype

This is a multiplayer game in which 3 or 4 players compete their button pressing speed and luck. The first person to finish pressing the button 100 times and releases an audio from the piezo buzzer wins the game. The catch is, you can only press the button during the timeframe after you roll the number six on a dice and before one of your opponents roll a six.

Again, I forgot to take a video of the final result...However, the above is an image of the final wiring and [this is a short snippet](https://youtu.be/mucXpLqc3tw) of how the LEDs blink once the game ends. Also, the final Arduino script is [here](../tree/master/Week201).

#### Process

I attempted to use an LCD to display instructions on the screen as shown above, however, after a couple hours of trying to make it work, I decided to refocus on the main objective of the game.  
  
It was also really interesting to see myself [being conductive](https://youtu.be/K4pV_2TpxA0).
